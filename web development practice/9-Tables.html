    <h1>Tables</h1>
    <p>
      Here we can discuss about tables.
      <br />
      First we add a tag of (table).In the opening and closing tag of table,we can two more tags of (thead) that means table header,and (tbody) that means table body 
      <br />IN the tag of (thead) we can use a tag of (tr) that means tables row,and in the tag of (tr) we can use another tag of (th) that means here we can write any text that we can use as heading in table.
      <br />
      In the tag of (tbody) here we can aslo use the tag of (tr),and in this tag we can use a tag of(td), and here we can write our information about heading.
      <br />
      Here is an example of table.

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
