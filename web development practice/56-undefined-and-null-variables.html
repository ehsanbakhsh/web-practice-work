    <h3>Undefined Variables</h3>

    <div class="container">
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>You can be empty a variable by setting the value to undefined. This type will also be undefined.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>var name = "Ehsan";</strong></li>
                <li><strong>var name = undefined;</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Now this variable contains no value, and it will cause error if we try to apply some operation on it.</li>

    <h3>Null Variables</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>This is another data type tht can only have one value and that is null value.</li>
            <li>A null value means that there is no value.</li>
            <li>It is not equillent to an empty sring("") or 0, i is simply nothing</li>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>var name = null;</strong></li>
                <li><strong>var nationality = null;</strong></li>
            </ul>

    <h3>Differance between null and un-defined.</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Un-defined </strong> means a Variable ha been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.</li>
            <li><strong>null </strong>is an assignment value. It can be asigned to a variable as a representation of no-value.</li>
            <li>Un-defined and null are two disinct types: Un-defined is a type itself (undefined) while null is an object.</li>
            <li>Unassigned variables are initialized by javascript with a default value of undefined. Javascript never sets a value of un-defined. Javascript never sets the value of null. That must be done programmatically.</li>
        </ol>
