    <h3>Recursive function:</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>A recursive function is a function that calls itself.</li>
            <li>Recursion is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedley until it arrives at a result.</li>
            <li>In some ways, recursion is analogous to a loop. Both execute the same code multiple times, and both requires a condition(to avoid an infinite loop, or rather, infinite recursion in this case).</li>
            <li>The classic example of a function whee recursion can be applied is facorial.</li>
            <li>Factorial of a number n can be defined as product of all positive numbers less then or equal to n.</li>
            <li>It is the multiplying sequence of a number in descending order till 1. Ot is defined by symbol of exclaimation(!).</li>
            <li>E.g : Factorial of 6 is: <br>6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720</li>
        </ol>
