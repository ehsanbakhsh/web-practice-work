    <h3>For loop.</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Loop in programming languauges is a feature which facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedley while some conditions evaluates to true.</li>
            <li>The far statement creates a loop that is executed as long as a condition is true.</li>
            <li>It will only stop when the condition becomes false.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>for (initiallization; condition; expression){ <br> //code to be executed <br> } </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Initialization is done by (one time) before the execution of block code.</li>
            <li>Condition for executing the block code and exit loop</li>
            <li>Expression is executed (every time) after the code block is executed.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Examples:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>for (var i = 0; i < 3; i ++){ <br> console.log(i); <br>} </li>
            <li>Output:
                <ul type="Square">
                    <li>0</li>
                    <li>1</li>
                    <li>2  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
