    <h3>Here we can learn about ALERT in js.</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>An Alert is a box that pop-ups to give the user a message</li>
      <li>
        Here's code for an Alert that displays a message <br /><b
          >Hi Buddy" Are you okay;</b
        >
      </li>
      <li>It's syntex is <br />alert('Hi Buddy" Are you okay;');</li>
      <li>alert is a keyword.</li>
      <li>
        The quoted text 'Hi Buddy" Are you okay' is called a text sring or
        simply a string.
      </li>
      <li>'Window.alert' and 'alert' are the same</li>
      <li>
        window is an object in the browser which contains many other objcts and
        properties, and alert is one of them.
      </li>
      <li>
        alert is a function that take any input and display it in pop-up to
        user.

    </ol>
    <hr />
    <p>
      From this function a pop creates when we can open the web page.As shown
      (when you open this web page) its syntex is written in the js file.When we
      use multiple Alet messages the web page can also show multiple alert
      pop-ups on the opening of web page as you seen when you open this page. :)
    </p>
    <h3>Function</h3>
    <p>
      This is the function
      <strong> alert('Hi Buddy" Are you okay;'); </strong> that i can used to
      pop-up an alert message in the web page. Because i can use two alert
      messages the syntex of next message is
      <strong>alert("Seriously are you okay;");</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      If we want to print a number in the pop-up hen we cant use quotes as shown
      in the syntex
      <br />
      <strong>alert(5);</strong>
    </p>
