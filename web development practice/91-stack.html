    <h3>Stack</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Stack is a linear data structure represented by a real physical stack or pile where insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end called top of the stack.</li>
            <li>The basic concept can be illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the top item of the stack in order to remove thingd from it.</li>
            <li>The basic implementation of stack is also called LIFO (Last in First out).</li>
            <li>To behave as a stack you have to use push and pop funstions on array.</li>
            <li>Push function will be add elements at the end in array.</li>
            <li>Pop function will remove and return last element from array.</li>
        </ol>
